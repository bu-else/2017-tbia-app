## Installation
To run the application, cd into `/client` folder and download the dependencies
```
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

## Running the app
In Safari, go to `Menu > Develop` and check `Disable Local File Restrictions` and `Disable Cross-Origin Restrictions` fields.

To start a local dev server for app dev/testing, run
```
ionic serve
```

To run the app with the Ionic CLI, run
```
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```
Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.

To setup an emulator, follow the guides
- [iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html)
- [Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html)

## Running tests
We follow the [Ionic Unit Testing Example](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-unit-testing-example) to write all of our front-end tests. The tests can be found in ```src/app/*.spec.ts``` and ```e2e/*.e2e-spec.ts``` files.

#### Unit Tests
To run ionic unit tests, run
```
$ npm run test
```

#### End-To-End Tests (browser-only)
To run end-to-end (e2e) tests, serve the app first and run
```
$ ionic serve
$ npm run e2e
```

#### Continuous Integration
We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for our CI workflow. Currently Travis covers our ionic unit tests but not e2e tests.
